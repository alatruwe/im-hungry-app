You now have a comprehensive and well thought out design for the MVP of your capstone.

The emphasis at this stage is not on perfecting the appearance and functionality of your app, 
but on developing just enough features to get it in front of users to get feedback on your idea. 

## Technical Requirements:
Implementation details are left entirely up to you, but at a minimum your app must meet the following requirements:

- Use Fetch to asynchronously load data from one or more APIs
- Use jQuery's DOM traversal and manipulation functionality to display the data from the API to the user in an interesting way
- Use jQuery's event listening capabilities to respond to user actions
